# Pages Module

This is a simple module for [Kohana PHP](http://kohanaphp.com) (an awesome PHP5 framework) for building the HTML `<head>` quickly, and easily. Pages also provides a simple approach to basic templating, and more reuseable views.

Documentation is still lacking, but I hope to get it done soon. We have started on it though.

If you have any questions or start using the Pages module, please [send me an email](mailto:sam@samsoff.es).
