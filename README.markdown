# Pages Module

This is a simple module for [Kohana PHP](http://kohanaphp.com) (an awesome PHP5 framework) for building the HTML `<head>` quickly, and easily. Pages also provides a simple approach to basic templating, and more reuseable views.

Documentation is still lacking, but I hope to get it done soon.

If you have any questions or start using Pages, please [send me an email](sam@samsoff.es).
