This is a simple module for Kohana PHP (an awesome PHP5 framework http://kohanaphp.com) for building the <head> quickly, and easily. Pages also provides a simple approach to basic templating, and more reuseable views.

Documentation is still lacking, but I hope to get it done soon.

If you have any questions or start using Pages, please send me an email at sam@samsoff.es
